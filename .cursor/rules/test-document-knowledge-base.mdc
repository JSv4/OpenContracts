# Testing `DocumentKnowledgeBase`

This document records the **canonical approach** for component–testing `DocumentKnowledgeBase` with Playwright-CT, Apollo Client mocks and Jotai atoms.
The component depends on many React-contexts, GraphQL queries, REST calls and external assets – missing any of them will usually surface as *silent timeouts* or *stack-overflows*.
Follow the checklist below and copy / adapt the helpers that already live in this directory.

---

## 1.  Always mount through `DocumentKnowledgeBaseTestWrapper`

`DocumentKnowledgeBaseTestWrapper.tsx` encapsulates **everything the component needs**:

* `MockedProvider` with
  * a minimal but **type-policy aware** `InMemoryCache`
  * an `ApolloLink` that
    • delegates normal requests to `MockLink`
    • intercepts **wild-card** `addAnnotation` mutations, returning a canned payload
* Jotai’s global `<Provider>` so every `…Atom` used inside the component is satisfied
* The optional `CorpusStateDebugger` that prints the corpus atom whenever it changes

Never mount `DocumentKnowledgeBase` directly in tests – you will miss at least one of the above.

Example:

```tsx
await mount(
<DocumentKnowledgeBaseTestWrapper
mocks={graphqlMocks}
documentId={PDF_DOC_ID}
corpusId={CORPUS_ID}
/>
);
```

## 2.  GraphQL mocks – common pitfalls

`DocumentKnowledgeBase` renders **before** it knows which tab / layer the user will pick, therefore a *surprisingly large* set of queries executes immediately.

1. `GET_DOCUMENT_KNOWLEDGE_AND_ANNOTATIONS`
2. `GET_DOCUMENT_ANALYSES_AND_EXTRACTS`
3. `GET_CONVERSATIONS`

Extra `refetch` calls are triggered when:
* the user selects an analysis (`analysisId` set)
* the user selects an extract (`analysisId` replaced by the extract id)

### Mandatory mocks

The test file `DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx` already includes a *complete* list that works for:
* a PDF document (`PDF_DOC_ID`)
* a TXT document (`TXT_DOC_ID`)
* the **unexpected** boot call where `documentId === ""`

When adding new tests, start by copying this array and trimming what you do not need – **never** delete the empty-string variant unless you are 100 % sure no component code path calls it.

### “Why do I see `Unhandled GraphQL request`?”

1. Variables mismatch – Playwright’s mock-matcher must equal the variables *exactly* (including `undefined` vs missing keys).
2. A second refetch for the same query – add the mock **again** (MockLink does *not* reuse responses).

---

## 3.  Asset & REST mocking

The component loads:

* `pawlsParseFile` (JSON)
* `pdfFile`    (binary)
* `txtExtractFile` (plain-text)
* `mdSummaryFile`  (markdown)

`DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx → registerRestMocks` has route handlers for all of them.
If you add a different document, remember to update the paths and ensure the asset exists inside `frontend/test-assets`.

---

## 4.  Playwright test guidelines

1. Increase the default timeout – PDF rendering in Chromium under Playwright is slow:
   ```ts
   const LONG_TIMEOUT = 20_000;
   ```
2. Wait for *visible evidence* instead of raw network-idle:
   * Heading with the document title
   * The “Summary” button with `.active` class
3. When interacting with the PDF canvas use **page.mouse** not **locator.dragTo** – the selection layer is an overlaid div, not the canvas element itself.
4. After synthetic drag operations, give the UI time to flush:
   ```ts
   await page.waitForTimeout(500);        // UI settle
   await page.waitForTimeout(1_000);      // Apollo cache settle
   ```
5. Assertions that depend on Apollo mutation results must target the **id returned by the mutation mock**:
   ```ts
   const annotationElement = annotationsPanel.locator(
     '[data-annotation-id="new-annot-1"]'
   );
   await expect(annotationElement).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15_000 });
   ```

---

## 5.  Minimal In-Memory cache

`mergeArrayByIdFieldPolicy` and `relayStylePagination()` are the only custom read/merge helpers retained.
Every policy that used external reactive variables was **purged** to avoid evaluation during Playwright’s serialisation (§ see 14681).

If your new test needs another root field (e.g. `fieldsets`) add it with *simple* `relayStylePagination()`.

---

## 6.  Troubleshooting checklist

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `Maximum call stack size exceeded` inside Playwright | Entire `InMemoryCache` serialised in the test | Keep cache definition inside the wrapper, **not** the test |
| `Unhandled GraphQL request` | Missing / mismatched mock | Add the mock with *exact* variables, duplicate for refetches |
| PDF never finishes loading | PDF asset missing | Ensure `test-assets/test.pdf` exists and `page.route` handler returns it |
| Annotation never appears | Drag did not produce selection, mutation not fired | Check drag co-ordinates, verify console log “REQUEST_ADD_ANNOTATION” |

---

## 7.  When changing component behaviour

1. Update the mock list – new queries, new variables.
2. Extend the custom ApolloLink if you introduce more wildcard mutations.
3. Add any new REST asset routes to `registerRestMocks`.
4. If you introduce new atoms, wrap them in the test `<Provider>` hierarchy.

Keep this read-me up-to-date; flaky tests usually trace back to one of the steps above.
