    Four cases bypass CSRF:

    * The ``Authorization`` header carries a *well-formed* token credential
      using a recognised scheme (``Bearer``, ``KEY``, …). Browsers do not
      auto-attach this header cross-origin, so CSRF is irrelevant.
    * No session cookie at all.  Without a cookie there is nothing for an
      attacker on another origin to ride; the request is fully anonymous
      and CSRF would only block legitimate Bearer-only API clients that
      momentarily have no token (startup race, refresh in flight).
    * A session cookie is present but the session has no authenticated
      identity (``_auth_user_id`` is unset). This covers the anonymous
      voting flow, which materialises an empty session row purely to
      dedupe votes by ``session_key`` — there is no logged-in user for a
      CSRF attacker to abuse. Without this branch the very next anonymous
      POST after a vote (a re-vote, a refetch, GET_ME firing during an
      Auth0 callback) would 403 because the SPA has no CSRF token to send.
    * (Implicit) Django private ``_dont_enforce_csrf_checks`` is honoured
      by setting it above for every bypass branch.

    unrecognised-scheme ``Authorization`` values are normalised to "no
