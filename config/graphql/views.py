"""Strawberry GraphQL HTTP view.

Replaces ``graphene_django.views.GraphQLView`` and the graphene-level auth
middlewares (``graphql_jwt.middleware.JSONWebTokenMiddleware`` +
``config.graphql_api_token_auth.middleware.ApiKeyTokenMiddleware``): the
per-request authentication those middlewares performed on first resolver
entry now happens once in ``get_context`` — same backend chain
(``django.contrib.auth.authenticate(request=...)`` walks
``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``: JWT / Auth0 / API-key backends), same
precedence (an already-authenticated session user is left untouched).

The GraphQL context object IS the Django ``HttpRequest`` — every resolver
ported from graphene keeps reading ``info.context.user`` /
``info.context.build_absolute_uri`` etc. unchanged.
