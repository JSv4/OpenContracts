# DocumentKnowledgeBase Layout Refactor Documentation

## üéØ Overview

This documentation set describes the comprehensive refactoring of DocumentKnowledgeBase from a rigid tab-based interface to a flexible, context-aware layout system. The refactor aims to reduce navigation friction, improve user experience, and create a more intuitive interface for document analysis.

## üìä Current State vs Future Vision

### Current State (Tab-Based)
- 8 separate tabs requiring constant switching
- Fixed sidebar positions
- No context awareness
- Limited customization
- Fragmented user experience

### Future Vision (Flexible Layout)
- Unified context feed showing relevant information
- Dockable/floatable panels
- Viewport-aware content delivery
- Customizable layouts
- Seamless, integrated experience
