# Phase 1 â€” Deliverables

1. **Working layout engine** showcasing docking, floating, resizing and tabbing with *dummy* panels only.
2. **`LayoutContainer`, `DockablePanel`, `layoutReducer`** fully typed and merged into `main` behind `newLayoutSystem` feature flag (default *off*).
3. **Playwright test suite** (docking, tabs, persistence, resize) passing in CI.
4. **Development documentation**: this set of Phase-1 docs plus updated `future-plans-implementation-guide.md` cross-links.
5. Green-light from internal QA that performance & accessibility budgets are met.
