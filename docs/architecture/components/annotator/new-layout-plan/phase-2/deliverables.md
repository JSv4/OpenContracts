1. **All primary panels** (Chat, Notes, Annotations, Context Feed placeholder) rendered via panel-adapters inside the new layout engine.
2. Shared **atom-based state layer** committed and documented.
3. End-to-end **feature parity** with legacy UI confirmed by automated and manual regression passes.
4. Feature flag rollout config updated so that *staging* environment defaults to the new layout.
5. Updated documentation (these Phase-2 docs + code comments) merged.
