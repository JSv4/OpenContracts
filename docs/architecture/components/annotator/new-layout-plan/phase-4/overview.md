# Phase 4 â€” Polish & Optimisation (Weeks 10-11)

## Goals

- Bring the new layout engine to **production-ready** quality.
- Squeeze maximum performance via memoisation, virtualisation and bundle audits.
- Harden the codebase with error boundaries, monitoring hooks and comprehensive tests.

## Scope

1. Implement performance optimisations outlined in Step 4.1 (`OptimizedPanel`, debounced feeds, etc.).
2. Add `LayoutErrorBoundary` with self-healing reset flow.
3. Finalise CSS theming & accessibility tweaks.
4. Conduct accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA at minimum).
5. Prepare gradual rollout (feature flag percentage bumps + monitoring dashboard).

## Success Criteria

- Interaction latency **< 100 ms** (95th percentile) for drag, resize and feed updates.
- Zero uncaught exceptions in Sentry over a 7-day staging window.
- Accessibility audit passes with no critical issues.
- 90 % positive feedback in beta survey.
