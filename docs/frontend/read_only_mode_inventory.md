## Implementation Status

### 1. ✅ DONE - Added readOnly prop to DocumentKnowledgeBase
```typescript
interface DocumentKnowledgeBaseProps {
  documentId: string;
  corpusId: string;
  initialAnnotationIds?: string[];
  onClose?: () => void;
  readOnly?: boolean; // Implemented with default value of false
}
```

### 2. Components Hidden in Read-Only Mode
- **NoteEditor** - ✅ DONE - Conditionally hidden with `{!readOnly && editingNoteId && ...}`
- **NewNoteModal** - ✅ DONE - Conditionally hidden with `{!readOnly && ...}`  
- **Edit Note button in NoteModal** - ✅ DONE - Hidden in read-only mode
- **Conversation history in ChatTray** - ✅ DONE - "Back to Conversations" button hidden, starts with new chat

### 3. Components with readOnly Prop
✅ **COMPLETED:**
- **UnifiedLabelSelector** - Disables label selection when readOnly=true
- **ChatTray** - Hides "Back to Conversations" and starts fresh conversation when readOnly=true
- **UnifiedContentFeed** - Has prop but implementation deferred (see below)
- **UnifiedKnowledgeLayer** - Passes through to children and hides "Edit Summary" button
- **PDF** - Passes read_only prop to control annotation creation
- **TxtAnnotatorWrapper** - Passes readOnly and allowInput props

✅ **COMPLETED - All floating components now have readOnly prop:**
- **FloatingSummaryPreview** - Has readOnly prop (no edit functionality present)
- **FloatingDocumentInput** - Hides chat mode button when readOnly=true  
- **FloatingDocumentControls** - Hides "Start New Analysis" button when readOnly=true
- **FloatingAnalysesPanel** - Passes readOnly to AnalysisTraySelector
- **FloatingExtractsPanel** - Passes readOnly to ExtractTraySelector

### 4. Components That Don't Need Changes
- **ZoomControls** - Zoom is inherently view-only
- **SidebarControlBar** - Navigation is view-only

### 5. Prop Passing Strategy
```typescript
// In DocumentKnowledgeBase component
const DocumentKnowledgeBase: React.FC<DocumentKnowledgeBaseProps> = ({
  documentId,
  corpusId,
  initialAnnotationIds,
  onClose,
  readOnly = false, // Default to editable
}) => {
  // Pass readOnly to all child components that need it
  // Hide components that have no read-only use case
}
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Wrapper Pattern
All component tests follow a crucial wrapper pattern to avoid Apollo query/mutation issues:
- Each floating component has a dedicated `TestWrapper.tsx` file
- Test wrappers encapsulate Apollo MockedProvider and Jotai state management
- All wrappers have been updated to accept and pass through the `readOnly` prop
- This pattern ensures clean separation between test setup and component behavior

### Test Coverage
- **Core Components**: Full read-only test coverage in DocumentKnowledgeBase
- **Floating Components**: Each has 3-6 dedicated read-only test cases
- **Edge Cases**: Tests cover both functional (buttons hidden) and non-functional (navigation works) aspects

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
✅ COMPLETED - All floating components now support readOnly mode
✅ COMPLETED - All floating components have comprehensive test coverage
⚠️ DEFERRED - **UnifiedContentFeed** full read-only implementation (see "Deferred to Next Sprint" section below)

### Low Priority (UI Controls)
6. ⚠️ Consider disabling **ResizeHandle & ResizeHandleControl** in read-only mode
7. ⚠️ Consider disabling **WidthControlMenu** in read-only mode
8. ⚠️ Consider whether **ControlButton** (panel close) should be disabled
9. ⚠️ Consider whether **ChatIndicator** should be disabled
10. ⚠️ Review **Graph Modal** for read-only behavior

### Tests Created

#### DocumentKnowledgeBase Component Tests
Comprehensive read-only mode tests have been added to `DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx`:
- ✅ Prevents creating annotations via unified feed
- ✅ TXT document prevents creating annotations via text selection
- ✅ Edit Note button is hidden in NoteModal
- ✅ ChatTray starts with new conversation and hides history
- ✅ UnifiedLabelSelector is disabled
- ✅ Edit Summary button is hidden in knowledge layer
- ✅ Annotation action menu shows only copy option (no Apply Label)

#### Floating Component Tests

**FloatingDocumentInput** (`FloatingDocumentInput.ct.tsx`):
- ✅ Test wrapper updated with readOnly prop
- ✅ Verifies chat mode button is hidden in read-only mode

**FloatingDocumentControls** (`FloatingDocumentControls.ct.tsx`):
- ✅ Test wrapper updated with readOnly prop

- ✅ Verifies minimize and back buttons remain functional
- ✅ Verifies knowledge layer mode with back button works

All test wrappers follow the crucial wrapper pattern to avoid Apollo query/mutation issues.

## Deferred to Next Sprint

### UnifiedContentFeed Read-Only Implementation
The UnifiedContentFeed component has been partially updated with a `readOnly` prop, but full implementation requires more invasive changes across its component tree.

**Component Tree Analysis:**
```
UnifiedContentFeed (has readOnly prop)
└── ContentItemRenderer (needs readOnly prop)
    ├── PostItNote (for notes - needs readOnly support)
    ├── HighlightItem (for annotations - has read_only prop)
    ├── RelationItem (for relationships - has read_only prop)
    └── SearchResultCard (for search results - view-only)
```

**Detailed Implementation Task List:**

#### High Priority - Core Prop Threading
1. **Update ContentItemRenderer interface** to accept `readOnly` prop
2. **Pass readOnly prop** from UnifiedContentFeed to ContentItemRenderer
3. **Replace hardcoded** `read_only={false}` with `readOnly` prop for HighlightItem (line 206)
4. **Replace hardcoded** `read_only={false}` with `readOnly` prop for RelationItem (line 258)
5. **Conditionally pass delete handlers** in ContentItemRenderer:
   - `onDelete` for HighlightItem only when `!readOnly`
   - `onDeleteRelation` for RelationItem only when `!readOnly`
   - `onRemoveAnnotationFromRelation` only when `!readOnly`

#### Medium Priority - PostItNote Component
6. **Add readOnly prop** to PostItNote component interface
7. **Hide edit indicator** (Edit3 icon) in PostItNote when `readOnly=true`
8. **Prevent note click handler** in ContentItemRenderer when readOnly (notes should not be clickable/editable)

#### Testing Requirements
9. **Update UnifiedContentFeed tests** to verify readOnly behavior
10. **Create ContentItemRenderer tests** for readOnly mode

#### Low Priority - Verification
11. **Verify HighlightItem** correctly handles `read_only` prop (should already work)
12. **Verify RelationItem** correctly handles `read_only` prop (should already work)

**Current Issues Found:**
- ContentItemRenderer hardcodes `read_only={false}` for both HighlightItem and RelationItem
- PostItNote always shows the edit indicator and is clickable regardless of parent read-only state
- Delete handlers are always passed and available, even when they shouldn't be functional
- No conditional logic for preventing note selection/editing in read-only mode

**Implementation Notes:**
- HighlightItem and RelationItem already have `read_only` prop support built-in
- The main work is threading the prop through ContentItemRenderer and handling PostItNote
- Delete handlers should be conditionally passed to prevent console errors when undefined
- Consider using a no-op function instead of undefined for handlers in read-only mode

**Reason for Deferral:**
These changes cascade through multiple child components and require careful testing to ensure the UI gracefully handles the absence of editing handlers. The work involves updating component interfaces, conditional rendering logic, and comprehensive testing across the content feed hierarchy.
