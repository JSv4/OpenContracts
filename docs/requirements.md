### System Requirements

You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed to run Open Contracts. We've developed and run the application a Linux x86_64 environment. We haven't tested on Windows, and it's known that celery is
[not supported](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37255548/how-to-run-celery-on-windows) on Windows. For this reason, we do not recommend deployment on Windows. If you must run on a Windows machine,
consider using a virtual machine or using the Windows Linux Subsystem.

If you need help setting up Docker, we recommend [Digital Ocean's setup guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04).
Likewise, if you need assistance setting up Docker Compose, Digital Ocean's
[guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04) is excellent.
