# Remote Ingest Worker

The remote ingest worker runs the **full OpenContracts ingestion pipeline**
(PDF/DOCX/TXT parsing + embeddings) on a beefy off-cluster host and streams the
finished documents -- PAWLs token layer, text layer, structural annotations,
relationships, embeddings, and any metadata you calculate -- into a corpus via
the [Worker Uploads](worker_uploads.md) REST API.

It is the tool for the "I have spare workstations and a 100k--1M document corpus
to populate" problem: the expensive parsing and enrichment happen on **your**
hardware, and the target instance just ingests the finished artifacts.

## When to Use It

- You want to **offload parsing and embedding** to your own machines instead of
  paying for it on the OpenContracts server.
- You have a **very large** local document tree (hundreds of thousands of files)
  to ingest resumably.
- You want each document to carry **calculated metadata and annotations**
  (detected dates, clause tags, typed metadata fields) produced by your own code.

### Versus the Bulk ZIP CLI

Both `scripts/bulk_import/` and `scripts/remote_ingest/` are CLI drivers for
large local corpora, but they offload different work:

| | Bulk ZIP driver (`scripts/bulk_import`) | Remote ingest worker (`scripts/remote_ingest`) |
|---|---|---|
| What it ships | **raw** PDFs (ZIP) | **fully-processed** documents |
| Who parses + embeds | the **server** | the **remote worker** (your hardware) |
| Offloads compute? | No | **Yes** |
| Endpoint | `/api/imports/zip-to-corpus/` | `/api/worker-uploads/documents/` |
| Pre-processing hook | -- | Yes (calc + inject metadata/annotations) |

Use the bulk ZIP driver when the server has spare capacity; use the remote
ingest worker when you want to throw your own hardware at ingestion.

## Faithful by Construction

The worker uses the same parser adapters as the server. Equivalent local
settings, service versions and source metadata preserve the parsing result:

- **PAWLs token layer** -- identical tokenization (no drift); the worker-upload
  path trusts these tokens verbatim.
- **Text layer** -- rebuilt from the shipped PAWLs with the same
  `plasmapdf.build_translation_layer` the server uses.
- **Structural annotations + relationships** -- produced by the real parser; the
  worker-upload path materializes a `StructuralAnnotationSet` and subtree-group
  relationships exactly as in-cluster ingestion does.
- **Embeddings** -- same model, same inputs (full text for the document,
  `rawText` per annotation).
- **Thumbnail** -- regenerated server-side from the uploaded source document (asynchronously).

## How It Works

A small **docker-compose bundle** runs on the remote host: the selected parser
services, an optional vector embedder, and a worker driver. The driver
is a resumable, per-document CLI:

1. `plan` scans selected extensions into a SQLite ledger.
2. `run` detects MIME, selects the configured parser, runs your enrichers, computes
   embeddings, and `POST`s a `multipart/form-data` payload (source + metadata JSON)
   to `/api/worker-uploads/documents/` with `Authorization: WorkerKey <token>`.
3. `verify` polls the target for each upload's terminal status.

Discovery streams in filesystem order; ledger reads use bounded keyset pages,
and submitted unfinished work is capped at twice `--max-workers`. The worker
paces itself against the target's worker-upload backlog. Re-running `run` skips
uploaded documents and retries unfinished work. Ctrl-C cancels queued work and
drains already-started calls; use one invocation per ledger at a time. See
[bounded traversal and resume](../../scripts/remote_ingest/README.md#bounded-traversal-and-resume)
for ordering, memory bounds, and upload replay limitations.
The worker needs **no database access** to the target: it only makes outbound
HTTPS calls to the worker-upload endpoint.

## Parser selection and local settings

Without a configuration file, the worker selects **Docling for PDF only**.
To enable PDF, DOCX and TXT, use the bundled
[`parser-config.example.json`](../../scripts/remote_ingest/parser-config.example.json):

```bash
export OC_PARSER_CONFIG=/app/scripts/remote_ingest/parser-config.example.json
export OC_PARSER_IDENTITY=parser-deployment-v1
export OC_EMBEDDING_IDENTITY=embedding-model-v1
# Start the services selected in that file, plus the optional embedder:
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml up -d docling-parser docxodus-parser vector-embedder
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker plan --extensions .pdf,.docx,.txt
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker run
```

`--parser-config /path/to/config.json` overrides `OC_PARSER_CONFIG`. Paths must
be visible inside the worker container. The file contains a `parsers` object
mapping canonical MIME types to component names/class paths, and an optional
`settings` object keyed by **full selected class path**. The example uses
paragraph chunking; remove that override to use TXT's normal sentence default.
A custom mapping replaces the default mapping, so a TXT-only worker needs no
PDF parser configuration or service.

| Input MIME | Supported component (under `opencontractserver.pipeline.parsers`) | Dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `application/pdf` | `docling_parser_rest.DoclingParser` | Docling service; `DOCLING_PARSER_SERVICE_URL` required |
| `application/pdf` | `warp_ingest_parser.WarpIngestParser` | Warp-Ingest service; `WARP_INGEST_API_KEY` required |
| `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` | `docxodus_parser.DocxodusServiceParser` | Docxodus service matching the frontend library version |
| `text/plain` (also `application/txt`) | `oc_text_parser.TxtParser` | No service; sentence chunking needs spaCy and its configured model |

To use Warp, replace the PDF mapping with
`opencontractserver.pipeline.parsers.warp_ingest_parser.WarpIngestParser` and
start `warp-ingest` instead of `docling-parser`. The bundle wires the same
`WARP_INGEST_API_KEY` to both service and worker. Docxodus/Warp are optional
Compose services; `worker` starts no parser services automatically. For
`--no-embeddings`, the vector embedder can also be omitted.

Settings precedence is **schema defaults < declared environment variables <
JSON settings**. All selected parsers are resolved through the application
component lookup, checked against `supported_file_types`, and configured before
processing documents. Unknown fields, invalid types, missing required values
(including secrets), invalid chunk recipes, and conflicting Warp OCR flags fail
startup. Field diagnostics omit values. Use environment variables for credentials;
never commit them in configuration files. To pass additional schema environment
variables through Compose, use `docker compose run -e NAME=value ...` or a local
Compose override; JSON also supports settings without an `env_var`, such as TXT
`chunkers` and Docling `use_cloud_run_iam_auth`.

These are **local settings**, independent of the target instance's admin/GUI
`PipelineSettings`. Equivalent source metadata, effective settings and service
versions use the same server/remote parsing and normalization methods. The
worker never fetches target settings. The extension list only filters discovery:
bytes are checked by the application's upload MIME detector, so renaming a PDF
to `.txt` still selects PDF. Unsupported/undetectable content or an unmapped MIME
fails before upload; the source MIME supplies both multipart and metadata types.

PDF retains PAWLS/token annotations and rebuilds `content` using the normal
PAWLS translation layer. Token page references index the PAWLS array; legacy
Docling page metadata can be one-based and is preserved. DOCX retains parser
content and character offsets. TXT
uses UTF-8 text with universal newline handling, matching text-mode storage
reads. Missing DOCX/TXT annotation types default to `SPAN_LABEL` on both worker
and target. Docxodus container `rawText` remains its heading (possibly empty); the shared
normalizer puts the exact covered section text in `annotation_json.text`.
Spans must match that field (or `rawText` for TXT), token references must resolve, and
annotation IDs, parents and relationship endpoints are checked before upload.
TXT emits stable `txt-N` IDs; other parser IDs are preserved.

`parser_name` is the selected component's title. `parser_version="1.0"` preserves
the normal structural-set provenance convention: it is **not a discovered
service/model version**. `LocalParsers.identity(mime)` exposes a defensive copy
of the class path, effective settings and implementation fingerprints.
That in-memory snapshot includes secrets: do not log or persist it. Callers may
supply different title/description envelopes; PDF `content` is reconstructed
exactly as normal persistence does. Settings synchronization, file conversion and
broader completion/readiness reporting remain separate work.

## Preparation checkpoints and source conflicts

The existing `/ledger` volume stores three atomic, digest-verified checkpoints:
complete parsed export/text, enriched export plus the existing metadata overlay,
and validated document/annotation embeddings. Restarts and rejected uploads reuse
every valid stage. Changing a stage's configuration invalidates it and its
dependents while retaining earlier work. Required annotation IDs, parents,
relationships and JSON embedding keys are validated consistently on fresh and
resumed preparation. The uploaded source is the same byte snapshot that was
hashed and prepared, even if its filesystem path changes in the meantime.

Set `OC_PARSER_IDENTITY` for the parser service deployment (or per-parser
`identities` in the JSON config), `OC_EMBEDDING_IDENTITY` for the embedding model,
and `OC_ENRICHER_IDENTITY` when using enrichers. Use stable non-secret revisions;
bump them when external models, helpers or effective enricher configuration/data
change. Parser service identities and embedding identities are required for
`run`; pure TXT parsing and `--no-embeddings` need neither service identity.
The expected vector dimension is `OC_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` / `--embedding-dimension`
(default 384). Partial or invalid embedding responses fail before checkpointing
or upload. Only `--no-embeddings` requests server annotation fallback.

Replanning changed, unaccepted bytes resets retry exhaustion and stale receipts.
Changes after `UPLOADED`/`COMPLETED`, or an uncertain POST, produce `CONFLICT` and
retain the old receipt. Lost responses, 5xx and unusable receipts produce
`AMBIGUOUS`; these rows are never automatically replayed. An operator must
reconcile acceptance/replacement with the server. Checkpoints provide local
recovery, not upload idempotency. Receipt access still requires the exact token
that created the receipt, even after rotating tokens for the same corpus.

Existing ledgers migrate in place; legacy rows start uncached. `worker cleanup`
removes unreferenced artifacts older than 24 hours using bounded traversal and
retains every artifact referenced by an active ledger row, including completed
or blocked rows. Run one command per ledger at a time. See the
[checkpoint and recovery reference](../../scripts/remote_ingest/README.md#durable-preparation-identities-and-source-versions)
for identity examples, retention rules and conflict diagnostics.

## Setup

### Prerequisites on the target instance

Worker uploads are ingested **asynchronously**: the endpoint only stages each
upload (HTTP 202), and a Celery task (`process_pending_uploads`) turns it into a
Document. So the target **must** be running:

- a **Celery worker** that consumes the `worker_uploads` queue **and** the
  `celery` + `doc_parse` queues (which carry the post-upload ingest stages,
  e.g. thumbnails on `doc_parse`). The stock compose images already do this --
  the worker starts with `-Q celery,worker_uploads,doc_parse`.
- **Celery Beat**, which schedules the periodic `process_pending_uploads` drain
  and `recover_stalled_uploads` (re-queues uploads stuck in `PROCESSING`).

If nothing drains the `worker_uploads` queue, uploads accumulate as `PENDING`
forever and **no documents are ever created** -- the worker still reports success
(202 / `UPLOADED` in its ledger), so this failure is silent. See
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting), and
[Celery Configuration for Worker Uploads](worker_celery_setup.md) for the full
infra reference (queues, Beat, scaling, verification commands).

### 1. On the server -- mint a corpus-scoped token (one command)

```bash
# mint_worker_token runs inside the Django container:
docker compose -f production.yml run --rm django \
    python manage.py mint_worker_token --corpus <CORPUS_PK> --worker-name <name>
```

This prints a one-time `OC_WORKER_TOKEN` **and** the `OC_CORPUS_ID` it is bound
to (the remote host can never target another corpus). The corpus must already
exist. See [Worker Uploads](worker_uploads.md) for the token model.

### 2. On the remote host -- run the bundle (a few commands)

```bash
git clone <opencontracts repo>          # the worker runs the real parser code
cd opencontracts/scripts/remote_ingest

export OC_TARGET_URL=https://opencontracts.example.com
export OC_WORKER_TOKEN=<token from step 1>
export OC_CORPUS_ID=<corpus id from step 1>   # informational; the token enforces it
export OC_DATA_DIR=/data/pdfs                 # your directory tree of PDFs
# One value, wired by the bundle to BOTH the embedder service and the worker.
# The embedder authorizes by comparing it to the request's X-API-Key header
# (its built-in default is "abc123"); a mismatch yields HTTP 401 on embedding.
export VECTOR_EMBEDDER_API_KEY=<any-value>
export OC_PARSER_IDENTITY=docling-deployment-v1
export OC_EMBEDDING_IDENTITY=embedding-model-v1

docker compose -f remote_worker.yml up -d --build docling-parser vector-embedder
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker plan
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker run --max-workers 8
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker verify
```

The directory tree under `OC_DATA_DIR` is mirrored into the corpus's folder
structure. See [`scripts/remote_ingest/README.md`](https://github.com/Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts/blob/main/scripts/remote_ingest/README.md)
for the full flag reference (`--no-embeddings`, `--flat`, `--limit`,
`--queue-high/--queue-low`, `--max-attempts N` (retries before a doc is PARKED),
`--insecure`, etc.).

### GPU acceleration (optional)

The slow step is the Docling parse. If the remote host has a GPU, merge the
[accelerated images](https://github.com/Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts/blob/main/compose/accelerated/README.md)
override to run the parser + embedder on it (auto-detects CUDA / ROCm / Intel
XPU·NPU). Vendor embedder overlays require the requested accelerator so a driver
or device-passthrough error is visible instead of silently reverting to CPU.

`remote_worker.accel.yml` is CPU-safe and contains no device mounts. Merge the
matching reusable vendor overlay after it: `accel.intel.yml`,
`accel.nvidia.yml`, or `accel.amd.yml`. Intel NPU hosts can additionally merge
`accel.intel-npu.yml`; CPU-only hosts can use `accel.cpu.yml`. The Docling
speedup is hardware-specific, so **benchmark your host** with
`compose/accelerated/bench_parse.py`. Full details:
[`scripts/remote_ingest/README.md`](https://github.com/Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts/blob/main/scripts/remote_ingest/README.md#gpu-acceleration-recommended-on-beefy-workstations)
and the [accelerated images README](https://github.com/Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts/blob/main/compose/accelerated/README.md).

```bash
export RENDER_GID=$(stat -c '%g' /dev/dri/renderD128)   # Intel/AMD; not needed for NVIDIA
docker compose \
  -f remote_worker.yml \
  -f remote_worker.accel.yml \
  -f ../../compose/accelerated/accel.intel.yml \
  up -d --build docling-parser vector-embedder
docker compose \
  -f remote_worker.yml \
  -f remote_worker.accel.yml \
  -f ../../compose/accelerated/accel.intel.yml \
  run --rm worker run --max-workers 8
```

On CPU, the stock `docling-parser` handles **one parse at a time** and each
scanned-PDF OCR can take minutes and use **3-6 GB RAM**. Size `--max-workers` (and
any parser replicas) to available RAM, not CPU count -- over-parallelizing OCR on
CPU can exhaust memory. Do **not** run the stock parser image with `uvicorn
--workers > 1` (its OCR engine races on startup and crashes).

## Pre-processing / Enrichment: Calculate and Inject Metadata + Annotations

Often you want each document to carry **more than the parser produces**: typed
metadata, a document-type label, or extra annotations you calculate (detected
dates, parties, clauses, an LLM classification). The worker runs a pluggable
**enrichment stage** after parsing and *before* embedding + upload -- so anything
you inject is embedded and ingested like the parser's own output.

An enricher is a callable `(EnricherContext) -> Enrichment`, wired in with
`--enricher module:function` (repeatable) or the `OC_ENRICHERS` env var. The
context provides correctness helpers (`find_token_matches(regex)`,
`token_annotation(label, match)`) that build valid `annotation_json`, and the
worker **validates** every enrichment before upload so a buggy enricher fails the
document loudly instead of shipping a broken annotation.

```python
import re
from enrichers import Enrichment, EnricherContext, label_def, metadata_field, TOKEN_LABEL

def enrich(ctx: EnricherContext) -> Enrichment:
    enr = Enrichment(
        # Typed corpus metadata (Column/Datacell -- the document metadata grid):
        metadata=[
            metadata_field("Contract Number", "058000"),                 # STRING (inferred)
            metadata_field("Effective Date", "2025-01-01", data_type="DATE"),
        ],
        # Label definitions for any annotations we inject:
        annotation_labels={"EFFECTIVE_DATE": label_def("EFFECTIVE_DATE", TOKEN_LABEL)},
    )
    # Inject token annotations for matched text (faithful annotation_json built for you):
    for m in ctx.find_token_matches(r"\b\w+ \d{1,2}, \d{4}\b"):
        enr.annotations.append(ctx.token_annotation("EFFECTIVE_DATE", m))
    return enr
```

```bash
docker compose -f remote_worker.yml run --rm worker run --enricher my_enrichers:enrich --enricher-identity my-config-v1
```

What an `Enrichment` can carry (all optional, additive):

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `metadata` (`metadata_field`) | **typed corpus metadata** -- `Column`/`Datacell` values (the UI's document metadata grid, successor to legacy metadata annotations). Corpus-scoped, typed, queryable. |
| `custom_meta` (dict) | a freeform JSON blob on `Document.custom_meta` (not the typed schema) |
| `doc_labels` (+ defs) | apply `DOC_TYPE_LABEL`s |
| `annotations` (+ labels) | inject token/span annotations; they get embedded + rendered |
| `relationships` | annotation-to-annotation relationships |
| `title` / `description` | override document title/description |

### Two metadata mechanisms

OpenContracts has two ways to attach document metadata, and the enrichment stage
supports both:

- **Typed corpus metadata** -- the `Fieldset` -> `Column` -> `Datacell` system
  (see [Metadata Fields](../metadata/metadata_fields.md)). This is what the UI
  shows as document metadata, it is typed and queryable, and it is the preferred
  mechanism. Emit it with `metadata_field(name, value, data_type=...)`. On ingest
  the worker get-or-creates a manual-entry `Column` (by name) in the corpus
  metadata schema and sets the document's value, type-validated against the
  column. Supported types: `STRING, TEXT, BOOLEAN, INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE
  (YYYY-MM-DD), DATETIME (ISO), URL, EMAIL, CHOICE, MULTI_CHOICE, JSON`.
- **`Document.custom_meta`** -- a freeform JSON blob for ad-hoc data that does not
  belong in the corpus schema.

## Security

- **Auth**: a corpus-scoped `CorpusAccessToken` sent as
  `Authorization: WorkerKey <token>` over TLS. The corpus is fixed by the token
  binding -- the remote host cannot reach another corpus or any other API.
- **No database access**: the worker only makes outbound HTTPS calls to
  `/api/worker-uploads/`.
- **No inbound ports**: the worker initiates all connections.
- **Enricher trust model**: enrichers are first-party Python you write and run on
  your own worker host; do not load enricher modules you did not write.

For production, run the target behind a reverse proxy with `limit_req` for hard
rate limiting (the per-token limit is best-effort).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `run` reports success (HTTP 202) but the ledger stays at `UPLOADED` (never `COMPLETED`), `verify` reports docs still-processing forever, **no documents appear**, and `worker status` shows the target backlog stuck | No Celery worker is consuming the `worker_uploads` queue on the **target** (uploads stage as `PENDING` forever). | Start the target's Celery worker (`-Q celery,worker_uploads,doc_parse`) and Beat -- see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-on-the-target-instance). |
| Docs `FAILED` with `401 ... /embeddings` (or land with no embeddings) | `VECTOR_EMBEDDER_API_KEY` mismatch between the worker and the embedder service (the embedder checks `X-API-Key`, default `abc123`). | Export the **same** `VECTOR_EMBEDDER_API_KEY` before bringing up the bundle so it reaches both services; recreate the embedder if you change it. |
| `run` gets an opaque **HTTP 400** from the target (empty body) and marks docs failed | `OC_TARGET_URL`'s host is not in the target's `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (Django rejects the `Host` header). | Add the host to the target's `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. (In production the real hostname is already listed; this bites local/testing targets.) |
| Parsing is very slow / the host runs out of memory under load | On CPU, each Docling OCR parse is serial and uses 3-6 GB RAM. Too-high `--max-workers` (or too many parser replicas) exhausts RAM/swap. | Lower `--max-workers`, add parser replicas only up to available RAM, or use [GPU acceleration](#gpu-acceleration-optional). |
| A few uploads stay `PROCESSING` after a worker restart/crash | Uploads were claimed but not finished. | `recover_stalled_uploads` (Beat-scheduled) re-queues them after `WORKER_UPLOAD_STALE_MINUTES` (default 15); ensure Beat is running. |
