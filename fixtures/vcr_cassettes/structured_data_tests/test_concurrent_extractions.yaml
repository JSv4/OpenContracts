      Listing all notes with metadata\n   - Accessing specific note content\n   -

      available to you, as additional specialized tools may be provided dynamically
      beyond the core set described above. Use the appropriate tools to gather information
      before answering.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Prioritize information retrieved directly

      METHODOLOGY:\n1. GATHER: Use available tools (similarity_search, load_document_md_summary,
      etc.) to find ALL relevant information\n2. EXTRACT: Identify the specific data
      requested in: \"List the terms defined under the ''Rules of Construction'' in
      Section 1.\"\n3. VERIFY: Before outputting, internally validate your extraction
      by:\n   - Confirming the requested information ACTUALLY EXISTS in the document\n   -
      Cross-referencing multiple sources if available\n   - Checking for logical consistency
      (dates in order, numbers reasonable, etc.)\n   - Ensuring no placeholder or
      generic values (like \"N/A\" unless actually in the document)\n   - Confirming
      extracted text actually appears in the source material\n   - For lists/collections:
      searching again with different queries to ensure completeness\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n-
      If the requested information does not exist or is not applicable to this document,
      return null\n- If a question doesn''t make sense for this document type, return
      null\n- NEVER invent, guess, or infer data that isn''t explicitly present\n-
      If data is not found after thorough search, return null/empty rather than guessing\n-
      If multiple conflicting values exist, choose the most authoritative/recent\n-
      For numeric values, verify they make sense in context\n- For dates, ensure they
      follow logical chronology and are actually present\n- For names/entities, verify
      exact spelling from the source\n- For boolean questions, only return true/false
      if you can definitively answer based on document content\n\nYour response must

      an expert assistant for document analysis and interpretation. Your primary goal
      is to answer questions accurately based on document ''Test Doc'' (ID: 1).\n\nThis
      document is described as:\n`USC Title 1 - Chapter 1`\n\n**Available Tools:**\nYou
      have access to a comprehensive set of tools for document analysis:\n\n1. **Vector
      Search**: A sophisticated semantic search engine that finds text passages similar
      to your queries.\n2. **Document Summary Access**: Tools to load and analyze
      the document''s markdown summary, including:\n   - Loading full or truncated
      summary content\n   - Calculating token lengths for context management\n3. **Notes
      Analysis**: Tools to retrieve and examine notes attached to this document:\n   -
      Listing all notes with metadata\n   - Accessing specific note content\n   -
      Calculating note token lengths\n\n**Important**: Always check what tools are
      available to you, as additional specialized tools may be provided dynamically
      beyond the core set described above. Use the appropriate tools to gather information
      before answering.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Prioritize information retrieved directly
      from the document using these tools\n- We intentionally did not give you the
      entire document initially. \n  Try doing some vector search to get more information
      initially and then iteratively \n  identifying which parts of the document to
      review.  \n- Do not rely solely on the summary or your general knowledge\n-
      Use multiple tools when necessary for comprehensive answers\n- Present your
      findings in clear, helpful markdown format\n- Avoid repeating instructions or
      disclaimers in your responses\n</BACKGROUND_CONTEXT>\n\nYou are a highly-intelligent
      data extraction system with advanced verification capabilities.\n\nEXTRACTION
      METHODOLOGY:\n1. GATHER: Use available tools (similarity_search, load_document_md_summary,
      etc.) to find ALL relevant information\n2. EXTRACT: Identify the specific data
      requested in: \"Provide the official citation format for this title.\"\n3. VERIFY:
      Before outputting, internally validate your extraction by:\n   - Confirming
      the requested information ACTUALLY EXISTS in the document\n   - Cross-referencing
      multiple sources if available\n   - Checking for logical consistency (dates
      in order, numbers reasonable, etc.)\n   - Ensuring no placeholder or generic
      values (like \"N/A\" unless actually in the document)\n   - Confirming extracted
      text actually appears in the source material\n   - For lists/collections: searching
      again with different queries to ensure completeness\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- If
      the requested information does not exist or is not applicable to this document,
      return null\n- If a question doesn''t make sense for this document type, return
      null\n- NEVER invent, guess, or infer data that isn''t explicitly present\n-
      If data is not found after thorough search, return null/empty rather than guessing\n-
      If multiple conflicting values exist, choose the most authoritative/recent\n-
      For numeric values, verify they make sense in context\n- For dates, ensure they
      follow logical chronology and are actually present\n- For names/entities, verify
      exact spelling from the source\n- For boolean questions, only return true/false
      if you can definitively answer based on document content\n\nYour response must
      be ONLY the extracted data in the format of: a JSON string value\n\nNo explanations,
      no process description, no confidence scores - just the final verified JSON.\n\nJSON
      Schema for your response:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\"\n}\n```"},{"role":"user","content":"Provide
      the official citation format for this title."}],"model":"gpt-4o-mini","stream":false,"temperature":0.7}'
