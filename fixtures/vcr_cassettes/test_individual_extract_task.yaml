      of this document?\\n```\\n\\nWe found the following most semantically relevant
      parts of a document:\\n```\\n========== Relationship Introduction ==========\\nThese
      lines provide a general introduction to how certain sections or clauses in this
      document interconnect. They help explain why the following relationships or
      diagrams may be relevant for answering the question.\\n\\n========== Sections
      Related to Nodes Most Semantically Similar to Query ==========\\nThe following
      sections show how the retrieved relevant text is connected to other parts of
      the document. This context is crucial because it shows how the text sections
      that matched your query are semantically connected to other document sections
      through explicit relationships. Sections marked with [\u2191] are the ones that
      were retrieved as relevant to your query. Understanding these relationships
      can help you:\\n1. See how the retrieved sections fit into the broader document
      context\\n2. Identify related clauses or definitions that might affect interpretation\\n3.
      Follow reference chains between different parts of the document\\n\\n==========
      Relationship Diagram ==========\\nThis mermaid diagram shows how the retrieved
      sections connect to other parts of the document. Nodes labeled as 'NodeXYZ'
      reference specific sections of text that might also appear in the detailed relationships
      or the retrieved sections below. If a node is marked [\u2191], it was deemed
      directly relevant to the overarching query.\\n\\nFirst, here's a visual graph
      showing these relationships. Each node represents a section of text, with arrows
      showing how they're connected. The text is truncated for readability, but full
      text is provided below.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\nNode479[label: section_header,

      with sections appearing in the 'retrieved relevant sections.' This is particularly
      useful for mapping which parts of the text reference one another.\\n\\nBelow
      is a detailed textual description of these same relationships, including the

      of this document?\\n```\\n\\nWe found the following most semantically relevant
      parts of a document:\\n```\\n========== Relationship Introduction ==========\\nThese
      lines provide a general introduction to how certain sections or clauses in this
      document interconnect. They help explain why the following relationships or
      diagrams may be relevant for answering the question.\\n\\n========== Sections
      Related to Nodes Most Semantically Similar to Query ==========\\nThe following
      sections show how the retrieved relevant text is connected to other parts of
      the document. This context is crucial because it shows how the text sections
      that matched your query are semantically connected to other document sections
      through explicit relationships. Sections marked with [\u2191] are the ones that
      were retrieved as relevant to your query. Understanding these relationships
      can help you:\\n1. See how the retrieved sections fit into the broader document
      context\\n2. Identify related clauses or definitions that might affect interpretation\\n3.
      Follow reference chains between different parts of the document\\n\\n==========
      Relationship Diagram ==========\\nThis mermaid diagram shows how the retrieved
      sections connect to other parts of the document. Nodes labeled as 'NodeXYZ'
      reference specific sections of text that might also appear in the detailed relationships
      or the retrieved sections below. If a node is marked [\u2191], it was deemed
      directly relevant to the overarching query.\\n\\nFirst, here's a visual graph
      showing these relationships. Each node represents a section of text, with arrows
      showing how they're connected. The text is truncated for readability, but full
      text is provided below.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\nNode115[label: section_header,

      Descriptions ==========\\nBelow are line-by-line descriptions of the relationships
      among key sections. Identifiers like Node123 link back to the nodes found in
      the mermaid diagram, and may coincide with sections appearing in the 'retrieved
      relevant sections.' This is particularly useful for mapping which parts of the
      text reference one another.\\n\\nBelow is a detailed textual description of
      these same relationships, including the complete text of each section. This
      provides the full context that might be needed to understand the relationships

      lines provide a general introduction to how certain sections or clauses in this
      document interconnect. They help explain why the following relationships or
      diagrams may be relevant for answering the question.\\n\\n========== Sections
      Related to Nodes Most Semantically Similar to Query ==========\\nThe following
      sections show how the retrieved relevant text is connected to other parts of
      the document. This context is crucial because it shows how the text sections
      that matched your query are semantically connected to other document sections
      through explicit relationships. Sections marked with [\u2191] are the ones that
      were retrieved as relevant to your query. Understanding these relationships
      can help you:\\n1. See how the retrieved sections fit into the broader document
      context\\n2. Identify related clauses or definitions that might affect interpretation\\n3.
      Follow reference chains between different parts of the document\\n\\n==========
      Relationship Diagram ==========\\nThis mermaid diagram shows how the retrieved
      sections connect to other parts of the document. Nodes labeled as 'NodeXYZ'
      reference specific sections of text that might also appear in the detailed relationships
      or the retrieved sections below. If a node is marked [\u2191], it was deemed
      directly relevant to the overarching query.\\n\\nFirst, here's a visual graph
      showing these relationships. Each node represents a section of text, with arrows
      showing how they're connected. The text is truncated for readability, but full
      text is provided below.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\nNode837[label: section_header,

      Detailed Relationship Descriptions ==========\\nBelow are line-by-line descriptions
      of the relationships among key sections. Identifiers like Node123 link back
      to the nodes found in the mermaid diagram, and may coincide with sections appearing
      in the 'retrieved relevant sections.' This is particularly useful for mapping
      which parts of the text reference one another.\\n\\nBelow is a detailed textual
