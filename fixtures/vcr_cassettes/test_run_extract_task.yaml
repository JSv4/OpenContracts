      to complete the task at hand.\nThis may require breaking the task into subtasks
      and using different tools to complete each subtask.\n\nYou have access to the

      annotations and text from within the Rando Doc\nTool Args: {\"properties\":

      this format is used, the tool will respond in the following format:\n\n```\nObservation:
      tool response\n```\n\nYou should keep repeating the above format till you have
      enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that
      point, you MUST respond in one of the following two formats:\n\n```\nThought:
      I can answer without using any more tools. I''ll use the user''s language to
