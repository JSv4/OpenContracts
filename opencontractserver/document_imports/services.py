"""
Shared document-import services used by both the GraphQL upload
mutations (``config/graphql/document_mutations.py``) and the multipart
REST endpoints in this app.

Centralising the logic here avoids duplicating permission, validation,
and storage handling across two transport surfaces, and keeps the only
real difference the way bytes are obtained (base64 string vs. uploaded
file stream).

Both transports terminate in the same place — staging documents into a
corpus or queueing ``process_documents_zip`` (see
``opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py``) — hence the "import"
naming. "Upload" survives only as the name of the transport verb on
the legacy GraphQL mutations.

    When ``corpus_id`` is omitted, a placeholder corpus is created
    synchronously (so the caller has something to deep-link / show in their
    corpus list immediately), preserving the historical behavior. When it is

    and no placeholder or additional permission rows are created. In either

    threads the flag through to them explicitly. See
