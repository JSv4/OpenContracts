"""Credential-aware construction of ``pydantic-ai`` model objects.

This module bridges the runtime-configurable LLM provider credentials
stored in the ``PipelineSettings`` DB singleton — an encrypted ``api_key``
plus a plaintext ``base_url``, declared on each
:class:`~opencontractserver.pipeline.base.llm_provider.BaseLLMProvider`
``Settings`` dataclass and managed live by superusers in the System
Settings UI — into the model layer that ``pydantic-ai`` actually invokes.

Resolution precedence is **DB-wins / env-fallback**:

* When the spec's provider has an ``api_key`` and/or ``base_url``
  configured in the singleton, :func:`build_agent_model` returns a
  concrete ``pydantic-ai`` ``Model`` whose ``Provider`` carries those
  credentials — overriding whatever is in the process environment.
* When nothing is configured (the default for a fresh install), it
  returns the bare ``"{provider}:{model}"`` spec string and lets
  ``pydantic-ai`` resolve credentials from the environment exactly as
  before. This keeps existing deployments byte-for-byte unchanged.

Any failure to build a credentialed model (unknown provider, a
``pydantic-ai`` API shift, a bad endpoint) degrades to the bare spec
string rather than raising, so a misconfiguration can never take the
chat path down — it simply falls back to environment credentials.

All ``pydantic-ai`` imports live here (not in the framework-agnostic
``opencontractserver.pipeline`` package) and are performed lazily so the
pipeline registry stays importable during early startup / migrations.

#
# ``_get_db_credentials`` runs on *every* agent build — every chat message,
# every structured-output call, every memory-curation task. ``PipelineSettings``
# already caches the singleton row (Django cache, 5-min TTL), so this is not a
# DB round-trip per call, but resolving a provider's secret still decrypts the
# Fernet store, and that decryption derives its key with a deliberately
# expensive PBKDF2 KDF (hundreds of thousands of HMAC iterations — see
# ``PipelineSettings._derive_key``). ``get_full_component_settings`` reads the
# secret store once per build (``get_component_settings`` already merges
# plaintext settings with decrypted secrets in one pass), so one KDF pass ran
# on every build once any provider key was configured (issue #1921).
#
# Caching the *resolved* creds amortises that across calls. Live-rotation is
# preserved: every credential write in production flows through
# ``PipelineSettings.save()``, which bumps ``modified`` (auto_now) and clears
# the singleton cache, so the next lookup misses on the new key and re-decrypts
# — a rotated or cleared key takes effect within the existing cache-TTL window
# with no redeploy (the live-configurability guarantee of issue #1897), and the
# cache adds no staleness beyond ``get_instance``'s own TTL. The same issue
# #1410 caveat applies: code paths that bypass ``save()`` (``QuerySet.update``,
# ``bulk_update``, raw migrations) won't bump ``modified``; call
# :func:`invalidate_credential_cache` explicitly in those cases.
