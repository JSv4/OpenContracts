    Base class for pipeline components, providing automatic settings injection.

    Pipeline components inheriting from this class will have settings
    automatically loaded from the PipelineSettings database singleton.

    Components should declare a nested `Settings` dataclass to define their
    configuration schema:

        from dataclasses import dataclass, field
        from opencontractserver.pipeline.base.settings_schema import (
            PipelineSetting,
            SettingType,
        )

        class MyParser(BaseParser):
            @dataclass
            class Settings:
                api_key: str = field(
                    default="",
                    metadata={"pipeline_setting": PipelineSetting(
                        setting_type=SettingType.SECRET,
                        required=True,
                        description="API key",
                        env_var="MY_PARSER_API_KEY",
                    )}
                )

    Settings are loaded once during __init__ and cached. Use reload_settings()
    to refresh settings from the database if needed.

    For backwards compatibility, components without a Settings dataclass can
    still use get_component_settings() to get a cached dictionary of settings.
    Each call returns a defensive copy; ``reload_settings()`` invalidates both
    the raw dictionary and the validated dataclass instance.
