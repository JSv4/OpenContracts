        therefore has to refuse the second call, and a plain
        ``refresh_from_db`` + status check is check-then-act: pydantic-ai can

        can both read RUNNING before either commits COMPLETED and both

        top of a row the first worker had just marked CANCELLED by soft time

        COMPLETED while still carrying the other worker's ``error_message``,
        after the user has already been notified the run was cancelled. No

        + ``markdown_body`` — and runs the citation post-processors over it
        exactly once, then appends the rendered ``## Sources`` footnote section.
        Composing first is what keeps the pipeline honest: a ``<cite>`` tag the
        agent put in its summary is rendered rather than leaking raw into the
        stored content (issue #2200), and every guard below sees the whole
        document, not just the body.

        The pipeline, in order:

        - ``_sanitize_agent_markdown`` drops agent-authored ``## Executive
          Summary`` / ``## Sources`` headings and the hyperlinks the (web-less)
          agent invented — every URL it emits is fabricated, and the ``<cite>``
          footnotes are the only sanctioned attribution channel.
          ``_summary_duplicates_body`` then drops a summary that merely restates
          the body; together these stop the report rendering twice (#2200).
        - ``_verify_cite_spans`` collapses self-echoing cite spans, demotes
          quotes that are not verbatim in their cited annotation (issue #2189),
          and strips citations whose anchor does not support the sentence
          (issue #2201). Each rewrite is corrective *and* counted into a warning.
        - ``_render_citations`` converts the surviving ``<cite ids="1,2">claim
          </cite>`` / ``<cite ids="1,2"/>`` placeholders into ``[^n]`` markers
          and builds the structured ``citations`` table; a concise
          weak-citation warning is appended when any footnote anchors a
          section-header label (``_is_header_anchor``, issue #2180) —
          observational only, it never rewrites the prose.

        ``retrieved_annotation_ids`` is the union of annotation IDs the
        retrieval tools surfaced during this run (the
        :attr:`PydanticAIDependencies.retrieved_annotation_ids` accumulator).
        It is the sole gate on what may be cited: an id qualifies by coming
        from a finding OR by appearing in the composed document, but either way
        only if retrieval surfaced it. That is the closed citation graph, and it

    opening (``RESEARCH_SUMMARY_DUPLICATE_PROBE_CHARS``) against the body rather
    than diffing two multi-KB strings: a genuine copy always matches from its
    first sentence, and a real 2–4 sentence summary — written to abstract, not
    restate — does not.

    Two known edges, both pinned by tests:

    * Being opening-anchored, this does not catch a summary that pastes the body
      after a throwaway first sentence. The observed mode is a verbatim copy of
      the whole thing, and a general dedup would mean the multi-KB diff this

    * A very SHORT summary built mostly around one verbatim body sentence reads
      as a copy, because coverage is a ratio over the summary: at ~150 chars a
      single quoted sentence is already most of it. A normal-length summary
      carrying the same quote stays well clear. The drop is reported by
      ``finalize`` rather than silent, since losing the whole section is a much
      bigger blast radius than the tail cases the other guards trim.

    Only the needle is capped; the body is searched whole, so cost is linear in
    the report — measured at roughly 6ms per KB, i.e. tens of ms for the report
    sizes an agent actually writes, against a task that just spent minutes in

    shortens the claim and fails open (the check is skipped or scores higher),
    whereas merging pads it with unrelated vocabulary and erodes the coverage
    margin toward a false strip — measured at 1.00 -> 0.40 for one unrelated
    preceding sentence, which stays above the floor but spends most of the

) -> CiteVerification:
    """Walk every ``<cite>`` span once and enforce the three citation guards.

    Per span, against the ``raw_text`` of the annotation(s) it cites:

    1. **Echo collapse** (#2200) — a wrapping span whose inner text merely
       restates the prose immediately before it collapses to the self-closing
       marker form, so the claim renders once with a trailing footnote instead
       of twice. The threshold is a ratio over the INNER text, so any tail the
       span adds beyond the restatement shrinks it: on a typical sentence a
       tail of more than about a word already falls under
       ``RESEARCH_CITE_ECHO_THRESHOLD`` and the span is left intact. What can
       still be lost is bounded by that same ratio, and a collapse that is not
       total is counted (``echoes_trimmed``) so it is reported rather than
       silent.
    2. **Quote verification** (#2189) — a quoted passage that is not verbatim in
       the cited text loses its quotation marks (prose and footnote preserved),
       so a fabricated quote degrades honestly to paraphrase.
    3. **Claim support** (#2201) — a cited sentence whose anchor text does not
       support it loses the citation entirely; the prose survives as uncited
       analysis. See :func:`_claim_is_supported`.

    The "claim" a span asserts is its inner text, or — for a self-closing
    marker, and for a span collapsed by (1) — the text it follows, so the guards
    apply to both sanctioned cite forms. Returns the rewritten markdown plus the
    three counts ``finalize`` turns into warnings.

    That trailing text runs back to the previous span or the sentence boundary,
    whichever is nearer, so in a compound sentence each marker is checked
    against ITS OWN clause rather than the whole sentence: in
    ``… pay taxes <cite ids="1"/> and maintain insurance <cite ids="2"/>``,
    anchor 2 answers for the insurance clause alone. That is the right scope —
    the alternative would judge every anchor in the sentence against the union
    of all of them — but it means a clause under
    ``RESEARCH_CLAIM_SUPPORT_MIN_WORDS`` passes unchecked, exactly as any short
    claim does anywhere else. A clause long enough to check IS checked, and a
    mis-anchored one loses its citation.

    A span whose cited ids yield NO usable text (textless anchor, deleted row,
    or an id retrieval never produced) is treated as ungrounded by both (2) and
    (3) rather than silently passing through — that is the "cited a real anchor
    but invented the content" hole these guards exist to close.

    The guards are independent, so one badly-anchored span can trip (2) and (3)
    both, and ``finalize`` will then warn about a demoted quote AND a removed
    citation for what reads as a single sentence. That is intended: the two
    remediations are different and both land in the output the reader sees. The
    quotation marks come off (so no fabricated verbatim survives) and the
    footnote comes off (so the sentence is not attributed) — reporting only one
    would leave the other edit unexplained.

    Known asymmetry across split markers: when the agent writes
    ``… <cite ids="1"/> <cite ids="2"/>`` instead of the combined
    ``<cite ids="1,2"/>`` the prompt asks for, the carried-forward claim feeds
    (3) but not (2) — the later marker's ``preceding`` is the blank gap between
    the tags, so quotes were already verified at the first marker against ITS
    anchors alone. This can only over-strip: a quote grounded in the second
    anchor but not the first is demoted to paraphrase (honest, and the warning
    tells the reader to check the wording). It cannot under-strip — a quote in
    NEITHER anchor is still demoted at the first marker, so nothing ungrounded
    reaches the reader through the split form. Unioning candidates across a run
    of adjacent markers would fix the strictness; it is not worth a lookahead
    pre-pass for a shape the prompt forbids.
