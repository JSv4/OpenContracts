One of the challenges with natural language documents, particularly contracts is there are so many ways to structure any given file (e.g. .docx or .pdf) to represent exactly the same text. Even an identical document with identical formatting in a format like .pdf can have a significantly different file structure depending on what software was used to create it, the user's choices, and the software's own choices in deciding how to structure its output.</p> <p>PAWLs and OpenContracts attempt to solve this by sending every document through a processing pipeline that provides a uniform and consistent way of extracting and structuring text and layout information. Using the parsing engine of Grobid and the open source OCR engine Tesseract, every single document is re-OCRed (to produce a consistent output for the same inputs) and then the \"tokens\" (text surrounded on all sides by whitespace - typically a word) in the OCRed document are stored as JSONs with their page and positional information. In OpenContracts, we refer to this JSON layer that combines text and positional data as the \"PAWLs\" layer. We use the PAWLs layer to build the full text extract from the document as well and store this as the \"text layer\".</p> <p>Thus, in OpenContracts, every document has three files associated with it - the original pdf, a json file (the \"PAWLs layer\"), and a text file (the \"text layer\"). Because the text layer is built from the PAWLs layer, we can easily translate back and forth from text to positional information - e.g. given the start and end of a span of text the text layer, we can accurately say which PAWLs tokens the span includes, and, based on that, the x,y position of the span in the document.</p> <p>This lets us take the outputs of many NLP libraries which typically produce only start and stop ranges and layer them perfectly on top of the original pdf. With the PAWLs tokens as the source of truth, we can seamlessly transition from text only to layout-aware text.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/PDF-data-layer/#limitations","title":"Limitations","text":"<p>OCR is not perfect. By only accepting pdf inputs and OCRing every document, we do ignore any text embedded in the pdf. To the extent that text was exported accurately from whatever tool was used to write the document, this introduces some potential loss of fidelity - e.g. if you've ever seen an OCR engine mistake an 'O' or a 0 or 'I' for a '1' or something like that. Typically, however, the instance of such errors is fairly small, and it's a price we have to pay for the power of being able to effortlessly layer NLP outputs that have no layout awareness on top of complex, visual layouts.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/asynchronous-processing/","title":"Asynchronous Processing","text":""},{"location":"architecture/asynchronous-processing/#asynchronous-tasks","title":"Asynchronous Tasks","text":"<p>OpenContracts makes extensive use of celery, a powerful, mature python framework for distributed and asynchronous processing.

That said, due to the nature of the types of documents we're working with - pdfs - there is tremendous variation in what the parsers have to parse. Some documents are extremely long - thousands of pages or more - whereas other documents may have poor formatting, no text layers, etc.. In most cases, OpenContracts should be able to process the pdfs and make them compatible with our annotation tools. Sometimes, however, either due to unexpected issues or unexpected volume of documents, you may want to purge the queue of tasks to be processed by your celery workers. To do this, type:</p> <pre><code>sudo docker-compose -f local.yml run django celery -A config.celery_app purge\n</code></pre> <p>Be aware that this can cause some undesired effects for your users. For example, everytime a new document is uploaded, a Django signal kicks off the pdf preprocessor to produce the PAWLs token layer that is later annotated. If these tasks are in-queue and the queue is purged, you'll have documents that are not annotatable as they'll lack the PAWLS token layers. In such cases, we recommend you delete and re-upload the documents.

Automated extraction saves countless hours of manual labor, reduces human error, and enables real-time data analysis. By leveraging an efficient extraction pipeline, businesses and researchers can make informed decisions faster, ensure compliance, enhance operational efficiency, and uncover valuable patterns and trends that might otherwise remain hidden in the data deluge.
